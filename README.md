# What's this?

This is my NeoVim config, tailored to the specifics of my projects. 

While this is made primarily for tracking and cross-machine setup 
(and showing off to fellow hackers; let's be honest, we've all done that), 
you, my dear reader, are free to tweak or look through it for inspiration.

Have fun!
